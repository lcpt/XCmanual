\subsubsection{LagrangeMP\_FE}
LagrangeMP\_FE is a subclass of FE\_Element used to enforce a
multi point constraint, of the form $U_c = C_{cr} U_r$, where $U_c$ are
the constrained degrees-of-freedom at the constrained node, $U_r$ are
the retained degrees-of-freedom at the retained node and $C_{cr}$ a
matrix defining the relationship between these degrees-of-freedom. 

To enforce the constraint the following are added to the tangent and
the residual:
\[ \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0 & \alpha C^t \\ \alpha C & 0 \end{array}
\right] ,
\left\{ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right\} \]

\noindent at the locations
corresponding to the constrained degree-of-freedoms specified by the
MP\_Constraint, i.e. $[U_c$ $U_r]$, and the lagrange multiplier
degrees-of-freedom introduced by the LagrangeConstraintHandler for
this constraint, $C = [-I$ $ C_{cr}]$. Nothing is added to the residual. \\  


To construct a LagrangeMP\_FE element to enforce the constraint
specified by the MP\_Constraint {\em theMP} using a default value for
$\alpha$ of $alpha$. The FE\_Element class constructor is called with
the integers $3$ and the two times the size of the {\em retainedID}
plus the size of the {\em constrainedID} at the MP\_Constraint {\em
theMP} plus . A Matrix and a Vector object are created for adding the
contributions to the tangent and the residual. The residual is
zeroed. If the MP\_Constraint is not time varying, then the contribution to the
tangent is determined. Links are set to the retained and constrained
nodes. The DOF\_Group tag ID is set using the tag of the constrained
Nodes DOF\_Group, the tag of the retained Node Dof\_group and the tag
of the LagrangeDOF\_Group, {\em theGroup}. A warning message is printed and 
the program is terminated if either not enough memory is available for
the Matrices and Vector or the constrained and retained Nodes of their
DOF\_Groups do not exist. \\




\indent {\em virtual void setID(void);} \\
Causes the LagrangeMP\_FE to determine the mapping between it's equation
numbers and the degrees-of-freedom. This information is obtained by
using the mapping information at the DOF\_Group objects associated with
the constrained and retained nodes and the LagrangeDOF\_Group, {\em
theGroup}. Returns $0$ if
successful. Prints a warning message and returns a negative number if
an error occurs: $-2$ if the
Node has no associated DOF\_Group, $-3$ if the constrained DOF
specified is invalid for this Node (sets corresponding ID component to
$-1$ so nothing is added to the tangent) and $-4$ if the ID in the
DOF\_Group is too small for the Node (again setting corresponding ID
component to $-1$). \\ 

\indent {\em virtual const Matrix \&getTangent(Integrator *theIntegrator);} \\
If the MP\_Constraint is time-varying, from the MP\_Constraint
{\em theMP} it obtains the current $C_{cr}$ matrix; it then adds the
contribution to the tangent matrix. Returns this tangent Matrix.

\indent {\em virtual const Vector \&getResidual(Integrator *theIntegrator);} \\
Returns the residual, a $zero$ Vector. \\
