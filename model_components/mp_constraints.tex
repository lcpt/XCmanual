\subsection{MP constraints}

\subsubsection{Description}
An MP\_Constraint represents a multiple point constraint in the domain. A multiple point constraint imposes a relationship between the displacement for certain dof at two nodes in the model, typically called the {\em retained} node and the {\em constrained} node:

\begin{equation}
U_c = C_{cr} U_r
\end{equation}


An MP\_Constraint is responsible for providing information on the relationship between the dof, this is in the form of a constraint matrix, $C_{cr}$, and two ID objects, {\em retainedID} and {\em constrainedID} indicating the dof's at the nodes represented by $C_{cr}$. For example, for the following constraint imposing a relationship between the displacements at node $1$, the constrained node, with the displacements at node $2$, the retainednode in a problem where the x,y,z components are identified as the 0,1,2 degrees-of-freedom:

\begin{align}
u_{1,x} &= 2 u_{2,x} + u_{2,z} \\
u_{1,y} &= 3 u_{2,z}
\end{align}

\noindent the constraint matrix is:

\begin{equation}
C_{cr} =
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2 & 1  \\
0 & 3
\end{array}
\right] 
\end{equation}

\noindent and the vectors defining the dof's at the nodes are:

\begin{align}
constrainedID &= [0, 1] \\
retainedID &= [0, 2]
\end{align}
